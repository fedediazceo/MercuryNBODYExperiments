Folders

MercuryBase6_5: Base folder with Mercury6_5 (scalar product fix)
MercuryF90: Just a base conversion
MercuryParallel-NoConsoleOutput: Base6_5 modified with parallel DRCT execution. Removed all console outputs on lines 6285-6286 and 6292-6293
MercurySinCosIntrinsic-NoConsoleOutput: Same as above, withotu parallelism but modified the custom code to compute sin-cos by using instrinsic language functions
MercurySinCosIntrinsicParallel-NoConsoleOutput: All of the above

50Cases: 
Inside here, in folder "Cases", there are 50 big[n].in files, which correspond to the proper cases executed. 
In order to use any of these ones, copy to the folder on the program you want to use, and rename the file to big.in.
To compile, remember to use the wizardry flag '-std=legacy', if not, face consequences and the wrath of the fortran godevs

Inside the folder "CaseGenerator", there is the case generator provided (it generates cases by providing a negative value starting with -2. Yeah, who knows)
There is also a bash script to run 50 executions in a loop, to perform the actual tests, called "GenerateCases.sh" 
Just a basic script

Enjoy!
